<p>Allocates \p size bytes of managed memory on the device and returns in
\p *devPtr a pointer to the allocated memory. If the device doesn't support
allocating managed memory, ::cudaErrorNotSupported is returned. Support
for managed memory can be queried using the device attribute
::cudaDevAttrManagedMemory. The allocated memory is suitably
aligned for any kind of variable. The memory is not cleared. If \p size
is 0, ::cudaMallocManaged returns ::cudaErrorInvalidValue. The pointer
is valid on the CPU and on all GPUs in the system that support managed memory.
All accesses to this pointer must obey the Unified Memory programming model.</p>
<p>\p flags specifies the default stream association for this allocation.
\p flags must be one of ::cudaMemAttachGlobal or ::cudaMemAttachHost. The
default value for \p flags is ::cudaMemAttachGlobal.
If ::cudaMemAttachGlobal is specified, then this memory is accessible from
any stream on any device. If ::cudaMemAttachHost is specified, then the
allocation should not be accessed from devices that have a zero value for the
device attribute ::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess; an explicit call to
::cudaStreamAttachMemAsync will be required to enable access on such devices.</p>
<p>If the association is later changed via ::cudaStreamAttachMemAsync to
a single stream, the default association, as specifed during ::cudaMallocManaged,
is restored when that stream is destroyed. For <strong>managed</strong> variables, the
default association is always ::cudaMemAttachGlobal. Note that destroying a
stream is an asynchronous operation, and as a result, the change to default
association won't happen until all work in the stream has completed.</p>
<p>Memory allocated with ::cudaMallocManaged should be released with ::cudaFree.</p>
<p>Device memory oversubscription is possible for GPUs that have a non-zero value for the
device attribute ::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. Managed memory on
such GPUs may be evicted from device memory to host memory at any time by the Unified
Memory driver in order to make room for other allocations.</p>
<p>In a multi-GPU system where all GPUs have a non-zero value for the device attribute
::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess, managed memory may not be populated when this
API returns and instead may be populated on access. In such systems, managed memory can
migrate to any processor's memory at any time. The Unified Memory driver will employ heuristics to
maintain data locality and prevent excessive page faults to the extent possible. The application
can also guide the driver about memory usage patterns via ::cudaMemAdvise. The application
can also explicitly migrate memory to a desired processor's memory via
::cudaMemPrefetchAsync.</p>
<p>In a multi-GPU system where all of the GPUs have a zero value for the device attribute
::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess and all the GPUs have peer-to-peer support
with each other, the physical storage for managed memory is created on the GPU which is active
at the time ::cudaMallocManaged is called. All other GPUs will reference the data at reduced
bandwidth via peer mappings over the PCIe bus. The Unified Memory driver does not migrate
memory among such GPUs.</p>
<p>In a multi-GPU system where not all GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other and
where the value of the device attribute ::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess
is zero for at least one of those GPUs, the location chosen for physical storage of managed
memory is system-dependent.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the location chosen will be device memory as long as the current set of active
contexts are on devices that either have peer-to-peer support with each other or have a
non-zero value for the device attribute ::cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess.
If there is an active context on a GPU that does not have a non-zero value for that device
attribute and it does not have peer-to-peer support with the other devices that have active
contexts on them, then the location for physical storage will be 'zero-copy' or host memory.
Note that this means that managed memory that is located in device memory is migrated to
host memory if a new context is created on a GPU that doesn't have a non-zero value for
the device attribute and does not support peer-to-peer with at least one of the other devices
that has an active context. This in turn implies that context creation may fail if there is
insufficient host memory to migrate all managed allocations.</li>
<li>On Windows, the physical storage is always created in 'zero-copy' or host memory.
All GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth over the PCIe bus. In these
circumstances, use of the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is recommended to
restrict CUDA to only use those GPUs that have peer-to-peer support.
Alternatively, users can also set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC to a non-zero
value to force the driver to always use device memory for physical storage.
When this environment variable is set to a non-zero value, all devices used in
that process that support managed memory have to be peer-to-peer compatible
with each other. The error ::cudaErrorInvalidDevice will be returned if a device
that supports managed memory is used and it is not peer-to-peer compatible with
any of the other managed memory supporting devices that were previously used in
that process, even if ::cudaDeviceReset has been called on those devices. These
environment variables are described in the CUDA programming guide under the
&quot;CUDA environment variables&quot; section.</li>
